### This app does not satisfy the problem statement stated by AppyHigh because of lack of CLIENT ID and SECRETE KEY that shoul be offered to the instagram developers.
### I have fetched the user data from facebook instead but I tried for instagram as well, Pls note that instagram does allow to scrape any thing from the app. How I was approaching for instagram authentication can be easily found unde component directory where there is a compnent known as Instagram.jsx

### I learned a lot while I was on this assignment given by AppyHigh. So... Thanks AppyHigh for considering me as a candidate.

# My Approach that I implemented succesfuly with FACEBOOK
